## The project
This React project consumes the JSON Placeholder API to return information about users.

For styling, react-aria-components was used alongside Tailwind CSS for basic theming, as well as styled-components for style management.

React Query was implemented to add a caching strategy and avoid unnecessary requests.

For testing, Jest was configured, and React Testing Library was used to conduct unit tests, ensuring code quality.

The build/compilation process was handled with RsBuild, which stands out for its excellent performance.
